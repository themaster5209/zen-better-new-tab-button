![Better New Tab button](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/491f3bac-897c-4e9b-bc76-51f802fa8727)

### Features
- Removed "New Tab" text, and the plus icon is centered for a clean look
- Clean animations for the button's bounce and the plus icon rotating on click
- Preferences to adjust how round the New Tab button and tabs are (disable to return to default)
- Consistent spacing around the button in regards to pinned tabs/the divider above it
- Works as intended regardless of whether you have pinned tabs in your workspace or not
- Looks just as good with any UI font and in both light/dark mode

### Installation
Using Sine is recommended as of v1.0.3 as there is now support for preferences. Simply copy the URL to this repository and paste it into the box directly under the marketplace! Alternatively, you can search for this mod's name in Sine's marketplace search.

For those who want a manual install and wouldn't mind going without the preferences, download the ``userChrome.css`` file above or from the latest release in Releases menu, copy it to your chrome folder, and restart the browser. If you don't have a chrome folder, follow the steps in [Zen's documentation](https://docs.zen-browser.app/guides/live-editing) to enable userChrome customisation.

### Additional information

- Should work on all future versions of Zen unless there are any breaking changes to the browser's code
- If you don't like any aspect of this mod, feel free to customise it either on your own or with AI
- [Nebula](https://github.com/JustAdumbPrsn/Zen-Nebula/tree/main) on macOS is the only theme that I have tested on, try/use with other themes at your own discretion
- Recommended to have New Tab button placed at the top (can be changed in 'about:preferences#zenLooks') to maintain the correct spacing that the mod offers
- Border radius preference for tabs unfortunately doesn't support Essential tabs, so those will stay at Zen's default value
