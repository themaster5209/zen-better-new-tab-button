# Better New Tab button
This is a mod for Zen that I made purely off vibecoding in my free time that changes some aspects of this UI - thought it'd be cool to put it out there for other users to install.

### Features
- Removed "New Tab" text, and the plus icon is centered for a clean look
- Consistent spacing around the button, mainly involving any pinned tabs above it/the divider when regular tabs are open
- Works as intended regardless of whether you have pinned tabs in your workspace or not

### Installation
Download the ``userChrome.css`` file above or from the latest release in Releases menu, copy it to your chrome folder, and restart the browser. If you don't have a chrome folder, follow the steps in [Zen's documentation](https://docs.zen-browser.app/guides/live-editing) to enable userChrome customisation.

Alternatively, for those using Sine, simply copy the URL to this repository and paste it into the box directly under the marketplace!

### Additional information

- This is a mod that should ideally/hopefully work on all future versions of Zen, unless there are any breaking changes made to the browser's code. If you don't like any changes or you want to modify it further you can easily do that either on your own or by using AI.
- The mod works properly on Zen without any themes (the default skin). [Nebula](https://github.com/JustAdumbPrsn/Zen-Nebula/tree/main) on macOS is the only "third-party" theme that I have tested on as it is the theme that I use; can't say whether it will work as intended for any other theme so test/use at your own discretion.
- I also recommend having the New Tab button placed at the top of the list (can be changed in 'about:preferences#zenLooks') to maintain the correct spacing that the mod offers.
