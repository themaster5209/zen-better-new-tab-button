# Better New Tab button
This is a mod for Zen that I made purely off vibecoding in my free time that changes some aspects of this UI - thought it'd be cool to put it out there for other users to install.

### Features
- Removed "New Tab" text, and the plus icon is centered for a clean look
- Consistent spacing around the button, mainly involving pinned tabs/the divider when regular tabs are open (this took way too long)
- Support for both [Nebula](https://github.com/JustAdumbPrsn/Zen-Nebula) theme and default Zen; Nebula is the only theme that I have tested on, can't say whether it will work as intended for any other theme so test/use at your own discretion

### Installation
Download the ``userChrome.css`` file above, copy it to your chrome folder, and restart the browser. If you don't have a chrome folder, follow the steps in [Zen's documentation](https://docs.zen-browser.app/guides/live-editing) to enable userChrome customisation.

Alternatively, for those using Sine, simply copy the URL to this repository and paste it into the box directly under the marketplace!

Since this is a relatively simple mod (and one that I just vibecoded for fun) it means that it should ideally/hopefully work as intended on all future versions of Zen, assuming that there are no drastic changes made to the browser's code. It also means that if you don't like any changes or you want to modify it further you can easily do that either on your own or by using AI.
